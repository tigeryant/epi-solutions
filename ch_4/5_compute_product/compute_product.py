"""
Write a program that multiplies two nonnegative integers. The only operators you are allowed to use are:
- assignment
- the bitwise operators >>, <<, |, &, ~, ^
- equality checks and boolean combinations thereof

You may use loops and functions that you write yourself. These constraints imply, for example,
that you cannot use increment or decrement, or test if x < y.

Hint: Add using bitwise operations, multiply using shift-and-add
