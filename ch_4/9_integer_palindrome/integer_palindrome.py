"""
A palindromic string is one which reads the same forwards and backwards, e.g., "redivider". In this problem, you are to write a program which
determines if the decimal representation of an integer is a palindromic string. For example, your program should return true for the inputs
0, 1, 7, 11, 121, 333, and 2147447412, and false for the inputs -1, 12, 100, and 2147483647.

Write a program that takes an integer and determines if that integer's representation as a decimal string is a palindrome.
